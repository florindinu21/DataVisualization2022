Nowadays, stroke represents one of the most common case of deaths, with aproximately 11% of total deaths, according to World Health Organisation.

The understanding of these worrying statistics led us to study the influence of certain factors in triggering a stroke. This project was designed to explore a dataset containing parameters like age,hypertension,body mass index,gender and a few more in order to determine wich pacient profile is exposed to a stroke.

Analyzing the actual statistics, we can conclude that studying the characteristics of the pacients could be the first step in understanding why stroke is one of the most common death causes. For the implementation, we used Python language, Spark framework, SparkSQL,Tensorflow and R language for some plots.


The project contains:
- Data manipulation using pyspark dataframe (read, process, data clean, etc.)
- Stroke related plots using python;
- Neural newtorks with dropout layers 
- R plots;
